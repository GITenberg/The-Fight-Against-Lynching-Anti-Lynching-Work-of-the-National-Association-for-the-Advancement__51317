  <h1 class="sp3">FOREWORD</h1>

  <p>The anti-lynching work of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is
  carried on as a part of the activities of the Association under the direction of the Association's
  Anti-Lynching Committee, whose names appear elsewhere.</p>

  <p>This work was made possible in the beginning through an initial contribution of $1,000 made by
  Mr. Philip G. Peabody, of Boston, Mass., in the fall of 1916, toward a fund of $10,000 to be used
  in a vigorous campaign against the lynching evil. The Association's president, Mr. Moorfield
  Storey, contributed a second $1,000 and as the result of a wide-spread appeal an amount slightly
  in excess of $10,000 over and above the cost of the appeal was subscribed. The Association is
  endeavoring to raise approximately $10,000 annually to carry on this work.</p>

  <p>The principal activities of the anti-lynching campaign include:</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p>Investigation of as many of the lynchings as possible.</p>
    <p>Publication and distribution of the investigator's findings and of other data concerning
    lynching.</p>
    <p>Inquiries and protests whenever lynchings occur, to governors, sheriffs and other state and
    local authorities by telegraph and letter, and, in selected cases, amounting in the aggregate to
    a considerable number, appeals to leading chambers of commerce urging them to demand that their
    governors and other officials take legal action against lynchers.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="page4">{4}</span></div>
    <p>Press publicity of such inquiries and protests and of the results of the Association's
    investigations and other matter of current "news" interest in order thus to create public
    sentiment against lynching.</p>
    <p>Research into the facts regarding past lynchings.</p>
    <p>Collection of press and editorial comment on lynching in general and on particular
    lynchings.</p>
    <p>Study of causes and remedies for lynching.</p>
    <p>Efforts to secure specific legislation to prevent lynching.</p>
    <p>Continuous agitation of the subject through the columns of the Association's organ, <i>The
    Crisis</i> and through meetings and addresses upon every appropriate occasion.</p>
    <p class="sp0">Generally to keep the evil of lynching before the American people as a live issue
    and to offer a constructive program for its abolition.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Association, through its president and secretary, acting for the Anti-Lynching Committee,
  took the initiative in promoting a National Conference on Lynching which will be held in New York
  City on the fifth and sixth of May, 1919, for the purpose of focusing the attention of the nation
  on this blot upon America's fair name and of working out an effective, constructive program for
  its abolition. This conference has been called by one hundred and twenty leaders of American
  opinion, it being judged best that the conference be called by distinguished Americans rather than
  by the Association itself, or the Anti-Lynching Committee, in order that the appeal might not be
  hampered in the minds of anyone by its association with the work of an organization devoted to the
  interests of the Negro, and to which there might be opposition on that account.</p>

  <p>Among the signers of this call are the attorney general of the United States, five governors,
  one of them, Governor Hugh M. Dorsey of Georgia, a southern governor, four <span class="pagenum"
  id="page5">{5}</span>ex-governors, one of these, Hon. Emmet O'Neal of Alabama, from the South, two
  ex-attorney generals of the United States, nine university presidents, the president of the
  American Bar Association, a number of leading lawyers of national reputation of the country,
  including Elihu Root and Charles Evans Hughes, Cardinal Gibbons and leading churchmen and
  representative colored leaders. Nineteen of the signers of the call are representatives leaders of
  southern white liberal opinion.</p>

  <p>The Association urgently appeals for financial support in its constructive efforts to stamp out
  lynching in the United States.</p>

  <h1>THE FIGHT AGAINST LYNCHING</h1>

  <div class="bq1 sp3">
    <p>"I therefore very earnestly and solemnly beg that the governors of all the states, the law
    officers of every community, and above all, the men and women of every community in the United
    States, all who revere America and wish to keep her name without stain or reproach, will
    co-operate, not passively merely, but actively and watchfully to make an end of this disgraceful
    evil. It cannot live where the community does not countenance it."</p>

  <h2><b>Comment by the Way</b></h2>

  <p>An increased executive and clerical staff has permitted the Association to devote more time and
  thought to its Anti-Lynching work and to conduct a more energetic campaign for legal trial of
  Negro alleged offenders, than in any previous year of the Association's history. Lynching is
  rapidly becoming a national issue. Under the stress of war time, mob violence has menaced
  communities heretofore relatively immune. Four white men were lynched in 1918. And yet, when all
  the facts are summed up, and we would be the last to minimize the evil of mob violence or to
  excuse it in the least degree, <i>the lynching of Negroes by whites</i> is the outstanding fact in
  the situation.</p>

  <p>Sixty-three Negroes are known to have died at the hands of white mobs during 1918, as we point
  out in succeeding pages. These lynchings might well be regarded as evidences of civil war were it
  not that <i>up to this time</i> the Negroes have not retaliated in kind. In the absence of
  combined action by Negroes forcibly to protect members of their race, the lynching of black men
  and women by white men for all causes and no cause, so far as crimes are concerned, can only <span
  class="pagenum" id="page7">{7}</span>be compared, although in lesser degree, to Russian pogroms
  against Jews under the Tzarist regime, or to Turkish attacks upon the Armenians.</p>

  <p>We would deeply deplore the forcible defense of Negroes by other Negroes, since it would
  perhaps lead to sanguinary conflicts between the lower element of whites and the Negroes, but no
  sane observer can fail to reflect that either white men, who make and enforce the laws, must stop
  mob attacks upon black men, no matter what reason may be given for the attacks, or confess
  themselves unable to maintain law and order and protect <i>all</i> citizens from unlawful attack.
  No class of citizens can be denied the protection of the law with impunity.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People fights this evil, as
  others in its program, with spiritual and legal weapons. Its appeal is to the heart, the mind, the
  conscience of America. It insists upon "ordered law and humane justice," to quote a phrase used by
  President Wilson in his appeal to the country against lynching. It has hoped that the better South
  would rouse itself and wipe out this terrible blot upon its honor. But the wait has been a long
  one. Can the Negro depend upon securing <i>his day in court</i> so long as he has no say as to who
  sits upon the bench, in the jury box, or who becomes the sheriff or chief of police? Think it over
  in the light of experience, ye voters and students of history and politics!</p>

  <h2><b>Extent of the Lynching Evil<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></b></h2>

  <h3><i>Previous to 1918</i></h3>

  <p>The records show that from 1885 to 1917, both inclusive, approximately 3,740 lynchings have
  occurred in the United <span class="pagenum" id="page8">{8}</span>States. Two thousand seven
  hundred and forty-three (2,743) of this number have had colored persons as victims and nine
  hundred and ninety-seven (997) have been white. The relative percentages of white and colored
  victims for the 33 years covered is 26 per cent, white; 74 per cent, colored.</p>

  <p>Assuming that the record for the earlier years is less accurate than for the later period,
  because of many factors (all lynching figures are probably minimum), the figures for the 18 years,
  1900 to 1917, both inclusive, are given. Fourteen hundred and twenty-seven (1,427) lynchings are
  recorded for the period named. Twelve hundred and forty-one (1,241) of these (86.7 per cent) were
  Negroes; 186 (13.3 per cent) were white. The relative decrease of white victims is marked.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The victims of the East St. Louis mob riots of July, 1917, are excluded, as are
  those of the mob riot at Chester, Pa. The number of victims at East St. Louis has been estimated
  at as many as 175. In the report of the Congressional Investigating Committee (House Document No.
  1,231, 65th Congress, 2nd Session) the Committee says that "at least 39 Negroes and 8 white people
  were killed outright, and hundreds of Negroes were wounded and maimed."<a id="NtA_2"

  <h3><i>During 1918</i></h3>

  <p>During 1918, 63 Negroes and 4 white persons were lynched, as established by well authenticated
  evidence.<a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The Executive Office has been advised of a
  probable increase of this figure by 12 cases of which it is said that confirmation of lynching can
  be obtained, but, as the Executive Office has <span class="pagenum" id="page9">{9}</span>been
  unable to investigate these cases, they have, of course, been excluded from our figures.</p>

  <p>An Association staff member, while in the South studying special problems, was informed by
  reliable colored people in Georgia that twelve unreported cases (in the press or elsewhere) have
  occurred since the Association investigated the Brooks and Lowndes Counties, Georgia, lynching
  orgy of May, 1918, and that the only apparent effect in Georgia of the President's lynching
  pronouncement of July 26th last, has been an apparently concerted agreement on the part of press
  and authorities to keep all news regarding lynchings out of the Georgia press. Lending some color
  to this charge, is the fact that, so far as we are aware, no Georgia daily has at any time since
  May, 1918, published any account of the investigation made by the Association or of the fact that
  17 names of mob leaders were put in the hands of Governor Dorsey, despite the considerable press
  comment in the press of other states.</p>

  <p class="sp3">One of our Texas branches (Houston) reported the case of one alleged victim of a
  mob who was buried secretly and no publicity given to the facts. The branch's president had
  written to the acting-governor requesting an investigation of the circumstances.<a id="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Finally, some lynchings which do not get into the press, are not
  carried beyond the immediate neighborhood, sometimes a very small one, unless there is some
  unusual feature to distinguish the event.</p>

  <h2><b>Special Features of Lynchings</b></h2>

  <p>Five of the Negro victims have been women. Two colored men were burned at the stake before
  death; four Negroes were burned after death; three Negroes, aside from those burned at the stake,
  were tortured before death; in one case the victim's dead body was carried into town on the
  running board of an automobile and thrown into a public park where "it was viewed by thousands;"
  one Negro victim was captured and handed to the officers of the law by Negroes themselves. A
  mother and her five children were lynched by a Texas mob, the mother having been shot as she was
  attempting to drag the bodies of her four dead sons from their burning home at daybreak, the house
  (only a cabin) having been fired by the mob. The crime in this case was "alleged conspiracy to
  avenge" the killing of another son by officers who had come to arrest him for "evading the draft
  law." This latter case has not been classified as a lynching.</p>

  <p>Most atrocious of all, so far as the community was concerned, was the five days' orgy in Brooks
  and Lowndes Counties, which has been made the occasion for special publicity and special efforts
  by the Association, to which reference is made on page <a href="#page9">9</a> of this report. In
  that case the particularly vicious brutality of the mob went beyond what one is prepared to expect
  from Georgia mobs&mdash;and one expects a good deal in the way of "cruel and unusual punishments"
  from them. The horrible cruelties visited upon Mary Turner, an eight month's pregnant woman, are
  recited in the investigation published of our investigator's findings.<a id="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3">In two cases the lynchings were carried out in the court house yard and in one of
  these picture post card photos were sold on the streets at 25 cents each.</p>

  <h2><b>Innocence Admitted Publicly</b></h2>

  <p class="sp3">In three cases of which we have record the press has spoken of the innocence of
  victims; one of these involved three persons, another the ten victims of Brooks and Lowndes
  Counties mobs (aside from the one person who shot the white farmer which was the incentive to the
  lynchings). In another case it is the common belief in the community in which a Negro was lynched
  for "killing a white woman" that the husband of the woman was himself the murderer. No charge has
  been brought against him, however, by the authorities. In such cases, Negroes are usually too
  fearful of danger and too hopeless of anything being done, to initiate legal action. In an
  additional case a bank cashier declared in an interview in an Alabama paper, that a certain
  lynching victim had committed no offense, that there had been a mistake made in the man the mob
  was after.</p>

  <h2><b>Legal Action Taken by Public Officials</b></h2>

  <p>Governor Thomas W. Bickett of North Carolina ordered the sheriff to investigate one case, but
  the sheriff reported that the "guilty parties could not be ascertained." The Governor in another
  case personally appealed to a mob at midnight and prevented the lynching of a man who was later
  hanged. The same Governor in November appealed to the Federal <span class="pagenum"
  id="page13">{13}</span>authorities and secured the support of a tank corps of 250 Federal army men
  to assist the authorities of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in holding the local jail against a
  mob which was attempting to get a Negro prisoner to lynch him.</p>

  <p>The Mayor and "Home Guards" of Winston-Salem, aided by the Federal soldiers alluded to,
  protected the aforementioned prisoner at the cost of the lives of some of the "Home Guards," for
  which public service, so unusual where Negro-hunting mobs are concerned, they should receive the
  tributes of all good citizens. (The Association's appreciation was made known to all concerned by
  a public commendation).<a id="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Governor Richard I. Manning of South Carolina ordered a sheriff to arrest 17 prominent farmers
  who had participated in a lynching. Bail was fixed at a total of $97,500, in February. From the
  Judge who placed the men under bail we learn that no indictments were found by the grand jury.
  "Lack of evidence," is given as the reason.</p>

  <p>Governor Charles Henderson of Alabama, in November, actively supported the attorney general of
  the state, who, at the instance of the Governor, personally took charge of an investigation of two
  lynchings which occurred in that state on the 10th and 12th of that month.</p>

  <p class="sp3">When a regular grand jury then in session failed to indict, a prominent detective
  agency was engaged and upon the evidence secured by them, a special grand jury, headed by a local
  clergyman, brought in 24 indictments. Seventeen men were lodged in jail without bail.<a

  <p>Publicity in the press was secured for the memorandum to the President and to the Attorney

  Negro (and $500, if white), has been given wide publicity among the branches and the colored
  press. (No one has claimed a reward from this fund as yet, however).</p>

  <h2><b>Illustration of Results Following the Association's Publicity Work</b></h2>

  <p>The following examples of results following publicity sent out by the Association and telegrams
  addressed to Governors and Chambers of Commerce are reviewed:</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page16">{16}</span></div>

  <p>On November 9, telegrams of inquiry and appeal for legal action in the case of the lynching of
  George Taylor at Rolesville, near Raleigh, N. C., were sent to Governor Bickett of North Carolina,
  to the County Solicitor of Wake County and to the Chamber of Commerce of Raleigh, of which that to
  the Governor was acknowledged. The Governor said that he agreed with the points made in the
  telegram and would back the County Solicitor in efforts to fix the blame for the affair. The
  Solicitor carried on an investigation for two weeks, examining 21 white and 9 colored witnesses.
  The coroner's jury ran true to form, finding that the victim came to his death at the hands of
  "parties unknown" to the jury.</p>

  <p>The two leading Raleigh newspapers, one of them owned by Secretary of the Navy Daniels, carried
  strong editorial comment against the lynching and criticized the dereliction of the officers in
  allowing their prisoner to be taken from them. One of them commented directly and favorably on the
  Association's telegrams to the Governor.</p>

  <p>Ten days later, as has been mentioned on a preceding page of this report, the same Governor
  appealed successfully to an adjacent army camp for help to support the mayor and "home guards" of
  Winston-Salem in holding the local jail against a mob which was attempting to seize a Negro
  prisoner to lynch him.</p>

  <p>The Chambers of Commerce of Montgomery and Birmingham, Alabama, acknowledged telegrams and
  letters of the Association sent during November, saying that they supported our view (that the
  lynchers of Will Byrd and Henry Whiteside should be ascertained and legal action against them
  taken) and that the Governor had ordered the action referred to on a previous page of this report,
  that of instructing the attorney general of the state to push an investigation of the lynchings at
  Sheffield and Tuscumbia, Alabama.</p>

  <p>Space forbids the citation of further examples. In many <span class="pagenum"
  id="page17">{17}</span>cases, however, no direct effect was produced by the Association's long
  distance efforts. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that no beneficial results can be
  credited to such of the Association's forty telegraphic inquiries (accompanied by newspaper
  publicity) as had occasioned no immediate action. Correspondents have written and callers at the
  National Headquarters have assured the National Officers of the value of this publicity work. In
  some cases local leaders among the white citizens have called upon colored people to assure them
  of their concern for the well being and protection of the <i>good</i> Negro and incidentally, we
  are told, to advise them against allying themselves with "northern agitators."</p>

  <p class="sp3">That the pressure of national opinion is felt and feared, even in the center of the
  lynching area, is evidenced by such editorials as that following a protest against a Louisana
  lynching, in which a local editor devoted a column of matter to "lambasting" the National
  Secretary under the caption "No Outside Scolds Needed." It was asked why this "Association with
  the long name" was endeavoring to hold Louisana up to the <i>scorn of the country</i>, etc., <i>ad
  lib.</i></p>

  <h2><b>Outstanding Events Aside From Association Efforts</b></h2>

  <p class="sp3">The most notable events affecting the anti-lynching campaign, aside from the
  Association's efforts, have been the President's July 26 pronouncement against lynching, the
  formation of the Tennessee Law and Order League to suppress lynching in March, and its announced
  campaign to stimulate the organization of similar movements in all the Southern states and the
  offer of <i>The San Antonio Express</i> heretofore mentioned.<a id="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> The latter offer is, of course, of scant promise for effective
  service in the campaign.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
